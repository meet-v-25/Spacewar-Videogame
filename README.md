# Spacewar-Videogame
This is a video game similar to Space-Invader. This is made using pygame library of python language. 

Instructions for Game:
➢ You have to enter the number of 'Enemies' viz 'Aliens in UFOs' and the speed of the enemies. 
➢ You have a 'Player' viz 'Space Ship' in the bottom part of the screen.
➢ The enemies do nothing but float around. 
➢ You can move your spaceship by pressing left and right arrow keys to move it in corresponding direction.
➢ You can fire 'Attacks' viz 'Pair of Fireballs' using spacebar, which will go straight up with a specific speed.
➢ For your score to increase, either or both of the fireballs must hit an enemy. 
➢ Everytime when a 'hit' occurs, the enemy is teleported to other random position.
➢ If any enemy manages to come close enough to your ship, a distance at which it can collide with the ship, then game gets 'Over'.
➢ When game gets over, your final score is displayed. You can save it by any external means.
